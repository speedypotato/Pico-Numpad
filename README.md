# Pico-Numpad

I had a spare set of numpad keycaps after building my semi-custom TKL keyboard.  I have a pi pico and the harvested switches from the board.  Let's put it all together just for fun.

Case is designed for resin printers, meaning no tolerance was added so dimensional accuracy is quite essential.

Parts Required
- 21x MX Style Switches
- 3x 2U MX Stabilizers
- 1x Pi Pico
- Keycaps
