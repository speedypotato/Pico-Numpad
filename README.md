# Pico-Numpad

I had a spare set of numpad keycaps after building my semi-custom TKL keyboard.  I have a pi pico and the harvested switches from the board.  Let's put it all together just for fun.

Note: I got lazy adding screw posts so currently it's taped together.  It also fits extremely tightly.

Parts Required
- 21x MX Style Switches
- 3x 2U MX Stabilizers
- 1x Pi Pico
- Keycaps
- 4x rubber stick on feet
